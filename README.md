# Conformity

A processing project I did a while ago. Was hosting it on my site but [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) broke after a while, and so did [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/). I guess posting a downloadable version is as good as I can get for now without rewriting everything in p5.

[Here](https://miyehn.me/#conformity) is a bit more description of this project.

On mac, run the `.app` file under `application.macosx/`. On windows, run the `.exe` file under `application.windows64/` Need to have Java installed to run.
